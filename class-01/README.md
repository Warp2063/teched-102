## Information

- This project is a sample *HTML file* that contains various *HTML tags* with some CSS styling included inline.
- The ***index.html*** file contains facts about palm trees.
- This includes the following HTML tags:
  - **\<html>**
  - **\<br>**  
    *These are line breaks.*
  - **\<img>**  
    *Image tags!*
  - **\<h1>** and **\<h2>**  
    *These are header tags.*
  - **\<a href>**  
    *These are anchor tags, for hyperlinks!*
  - **\<ol>** with its associated **\<li>** tags  
    *Ordered lists, but unordered lists also exist.*

> Palm trees are cool, right?
> Though often they're found in warm climes!
>> I should really focus on what the project is about, though.
>> 1. It's about the *HTML*.
>> 2. And also about the *Markdown.*
>> 3. But a little about ***Palm Trees.*** For flavor, of course.
