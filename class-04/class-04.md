Customer/client comes to us with a project.

Develop a *wireframe*, a rough sketch on paper of what is needed.

The frontend developer then receives that wireframe and creates a good-looking *mockup* based on that prototype.  Shapes and such.

The next person will take the mockup and develop a *prototype*.  In this they will define measurements of the various elements and colors for the mockup.  You can then show the finalized wireframe to the customer/client for approval.  If they approve, we can then go ahead and begin coding.
