  Loop example using the Fibonacci sequence: (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...)


  <script>
    let a = 1, b = 1;

    let number = 30; // This number is the # in the sequence that we want to discover.

    // loop starts at i = 3
    // because we already know that the first and second Fib. numbers are 1 and 1
    for (var i = 3; i <= number; i++) {
      let temp = a + b; // add the last two numbers from the sequence together
      console.log("Fibonacci #" + i + " is " + temp); // display the output for this loop
      a = b; // move b into a
      b = temp; // move this loop's result into b

      // and onto the next loop!
    }
